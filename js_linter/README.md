# Js Linter

I paired down linter for JavaScript written in Python.

## Run from command line
./lint.sh <file-name>

## Todo

- [x] - Allow linting to be ran from the command line
- [x] - Allow client to pass a file in command line to lint
- [] - Provide line number of error
  - [] - for closing brace mismatch
  - [] - for opening brace mismatch
