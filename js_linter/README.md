# Js Linter

I paired down linter for JavaScript written in Python.

## Run from command line
`./lint.sh <filepath>`

## Todo

- [x] - Allow linting to be ran from the command line
- [x] - Allow client to pass a file in command line to lint
- [x] - Provide line number of error
  - [x] - for brace mismatch
  - [x] - for opening brace not closed
  - [x] - for closing brace not opened
